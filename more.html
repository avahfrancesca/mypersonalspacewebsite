    <p class="more">My Personal space website is built using the three programming language which is the HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. HTML is the language used to create the structure of a webpage. It defines the content and layout of
        elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, buttons, and more. CSS is used to style and design the HTML.
        It controls how the website will look, including the colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, and animations. It makes
        the website visually appealing and responsive. JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity
        and dynamic to the website. You can make buttons work, show, create animations, and manymore. This site includes
        sections like Home, About Me, Courses, and the Life events that shows the experience of a first year tamaraw.
        The three programming languages is very essential when it comes to web development to have a functional and eye
        pleasing website.</p><br>
